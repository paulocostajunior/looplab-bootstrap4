# looplab-bootstrap4

This is the first project from the course Bootstrap 4. 
<br/>
It was built using HTML,CSS, JQUERY and obviously the library Bootsrap.
<br/>
The reason i took this course was to improve my bootstrap skills and also to be more fluent with it.

# Project setup
It's very easy to get it working. Just clone the project and double click index.html file, by doing that it would simply run in your default browser.
